My name is Kamran Mammadzada. I am a data sciense enthusiast with the passion for learning and knowledge. I started this blog in order to share my journey in learning data science as well as share my progress, various projects that I have done. To keep it simple I divided my blog into 2 major categories: data science learning and projects. Data Science learning category contains posts where I share my experience of learning data science, explore interesting topics of both technical and non-technical nature. In projects I try to tackle various challenges using existing datasets and tutorials covering certain topics.
